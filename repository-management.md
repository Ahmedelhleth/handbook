# Repository Management

## Package Names

Package names for the official `wp-cli` GitHub repository need to be discussed upfront with the [maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/wp-cli/teams/maintainers).

Package names for WP-CLI commands must end with the `-command` suffix. Example: `wp-cli/scaffold-package-command`.
