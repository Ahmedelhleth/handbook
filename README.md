===============

These files comprise the WP-CLI handbook ([make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/)).

The documentation is located in GitHub to enable a pull request-based editing workflow. They are imported automatically into WordPress.org using a [WordPress plugin](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wporg-cli/inc/class-markdown-import.php) running on make.wordpress.org/cli.
