# wp shell

Interactive PHP console.

`wp shell` allows you to evaluate PHP statements and expressions
interactively, from within a WordPress environment. Type a bit of code,
hit enter, and see the code execute right before you. Because WordPress
is loaded, you have access to all the functions, classes and globals
that you can use within a WordPress plugin, for example.

### OPTIONS

[\--basic]
: Start in fail-safe mode, even if Boris is available.

### EXAMPLES

    # Call get_bloginfo() to get the name of the site.
    $ wp shell
    wp> get_bloginfo( 'name' );
    => string(6) "WP-CLI"

### GLOBAL PARAMETERS

WP-CLI has a [series of global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) that work with all commands. They are called _global parameters_ because they affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress and have the same behavior across all commands.

Common global parameters include:

| **Argument**    | **Description**              |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `--path=<path>` | Path to the WordPress files. |
| `--url=<url>`   | Pretend request came from given URL. In multisite, this argument is how the target site is specified. |
| `--user=<user>` | Set the WordPress user.      |
| `--require=<path>` | Load PHP file before running the command (may be used more than once). |
| `--skip-plugins[=<plugin>]` | Skip loading all or some plugins. Note: mu-plugins are still loaded. |
| `--skip-themes[=<theme>]` | Skip loading all or some themes. |

See [global parameter documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) for the full list and other configuration options.
