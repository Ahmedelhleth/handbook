# wp db import

Import a database from a file or from STDIN.

Runs SQL queries using `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and
`DB_PASSWORD` database credentials specified in wp-config.php. This
does not create database by itself and only performs whatever tasks are
defined in the SQL.

### OPTIONS

[&lt;file&gt;]
: The name of the SQL file to import. If '-', then reads from STDIN. If omitted, it will look for '{dbname}.sql'.

[\--skip-optimization]
: When using an SQL file, do not include speed optimization such as disabling auto-commit and key checks.

### EXAMPLES

    # Import MySQL from a file.
    $ wp db import wordpress_dbase.sql
    Success: Imported from 'wordpress_dbase.sql'.

### GLOBAL PARAMETERS

WP-CLI has a [series of global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) that work with all commands. They are called _global parameters_ because they affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress and have the same behavior across all commands.

Common global parameters include:

| **Argument**    | **Description**              |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `--path=<path>` | Path to the WordPress files. |
| `--url=<url>`   | Pretend request came from given URL. In multisite, this argument is how the target site is specified. |
| `--user=<user>` | Set the WordPress user.      |
| `--require=<path>` | Load PHP file before running the command (may be used more than once). |
| `--skip-plugins[=<plugin>]` | Skip loading all or some plugins. Note: mu-plugins are still loaded. |
| `--skip-themes[=<theme>]` | Skip loading all or some themes. |

See [global parameter documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) for the full list and other configuration options.
