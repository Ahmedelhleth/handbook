# wp core update

Update WordPress to a newer version.

Defaults to updating WordPress to the latest version.

If you see "Error: Another update is currently in progress.", you may
need to run `wp option delete core_updater.lock` after verifying another
update isn't actually running.

### OPTIONS

[&lt;zip&gt;]
: Path to zip file to use, instead of downloading from wordpress.org.

[\--minor]
: Only perform updates for minor releases (e.g. update from WP 4.3 to 4.3.3 instead of 4.4.2).

[\--version=&lt;version&gt;]
: Update to a specific version, instead of to the latest version. Alternatively accepts 'nightly'.

[\--force]
: Update even when installed WP version is greater than the requested version.

[\--locale=&lt;locale&gt;]
: Select which language you want to download.

### GLOBAL PARAMETERS

WP-CLI has a [series of global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) that work with all commands. They are called _global parameters_ because they affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress and have the same behavior across all commands.

Common global parameters include:

| **Argument**    | **Description**              |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `--path=<path>` | Path to the WordPress files. |
| `--url=<url>`   | Pretend request came from given URL. In multisite, this argument is how the target site is specified. |
| `--user=<user>` | Set the WordPress user.      |
| `--require=<path>` | Load PHP file before running the command (may be used more than once). |
| `--skip-plugins[=<plugin>]` | Skip loading all or some plugins. Note: mu-plugins are still loaded. |
| `--skip-themes[=<theme>]` | Skip loading all or some themes. |

See [global parameter documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) for the full list and other configuration options.
