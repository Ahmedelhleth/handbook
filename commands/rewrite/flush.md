# wp rewrite flush

Flush rewrite rules.

Resets WordPress' rewrite rules based on registered post types, etc.

To regenerate a .htaccess file with WP-CLI, you'll need to add the mod_rewrite module
to your wp-cli.yml or config.yml. For example:

```
apache_modules:
  - mod_rewrite
```

### OPTIONS

[\--hard]
: Perform a hard flush - update `.htaccess` rules as well as rewrite rules in database. Works only on single site installs.

### EXAMPLES

    $ wp rewrite flush
    Success: Rewrite rules flushed.

### GLOBAL PARAMETERS

WP-CLI has a [series of global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) that work with all commands. They are called _global parameters_ because they affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress and have the same behavior across all commands.

Common global parameters include:

| **Argument**    | **Description**              |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `--path=<path>` | Path to the WordPress files. |
| `--url=<url>`   | Pretend request came from given URL. In multisite, this argument is how the target site is specified. |
| `--user=<user>` | Set the WordPress user.      |
| `--skip-plugins[=<plugin>]` | Skip loading all or some plugins. Note: mu-plugins are still loaded. |
| `--skip-themes[=<theme>]` | Skip loading all or some themes. |

See [global parameter documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) for the full list and other configuration options.
