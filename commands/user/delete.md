# wp user delete

Delete one or more users from the current site.

On multisite, `wp user delete` only removes the user from the current
site. Include `--network` to also remove the user from the database, but
make sure to reassign their posts prior to deleting the user.

### OPTIONS

&lt;user&gt;...
: The user login, user email, or user ID of the user(s) to delete.

[\--network]
: On multisite, delete the user from the entire network.

[\--reassign=&lt;user-id&gt;]
: User ID to reassign the posts to.

[\--yes]
: Answer yes to any confirmation prompts.

### EXAMPLES

    # Delete user 123 and reassign posts to user 567
    $ wp user delete 123 --reassign=567
    Success: Removed user 123 from http://example.com

    # Delete all contributors and reassign their posts to user 2
    $ wp user delete $(wp user list --role=contributor --field=ID) --reassign=2
    Success: Removed user 813 from http://example.com
    Success: Removed user 578 from http://example.com

### GLOBAL PARAMETERS

WP-CLI has a [series of global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) that work with all commands. They are called _global parameters_ because they affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress and have the same behavior across all commands.

Common global parameters include:

| **Argument**    | **Description**              |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `--path=<path>` | Path to the WordPress files. |
| `--url=<url>`   | Pretend request came from given URL. In multisite, this argument is how the target site is specified. |
| `--user=<user>` | Set the WordPress user.      |
| `--require=<path>` | Load PHP file before running the command (may be used more than once). |
| `--skip-plugins[=<plugin>]` | Skip loading all or some plugins. Note: mu-plugins are still loaded. |
| `--skip-themes[=<theme>]` | Skip loading all or some themes. |

See [global parameter documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) for the full list and other configuration options.
