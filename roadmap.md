# Roadmap

WP-CLI is released every 3-4 months, typically around the beta period of [WordPress's release cycle](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/):

* Current: [v1.3.0](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/) (August 8, 2017)
* Next: v1.4.0 (TBD)
* Breaking changes: v2.0.0 (spring 2018)

Patch versions are released on an as-needed basis, usually to address bugs or regressions. The current version of WP-CLI is the only officially supported version.

Just like WordPress has plugins, the future of WP-CLI is [packages of commands](https://wp-cli.org/package-index/). WP-CLI's current product focus is to:

* Help community packages be considered first-class citizens amongst the commands bundled with WP-CLI (in build quality, documentation, test coverage, and discoverability).
* Encourage package maintenance to be a communal activity, instead of falling upon a single person.

New features are developed as community packages first. Doing so enables:

* Faster feature iteration with less risk.
* More contribution opportunities.
* Reduced complexity and maintenance burden for the core project.
